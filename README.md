# Deep Learning Specialisation

The Deep Learning Specialisation by Andrew Ng, Kian Katanforoosh and Younes Bensouda Mourri is a set of courses focusing on the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning with the fast-paced development of leading-edge AI technology im mind. The curriculum includes lessons on building and training neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialisation, etc. The couse explores theoretical concepts of deep learning and their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow and how to tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, etc.

This repository contains hands-on projects from the Deep Learning Specialisation, including my work completed as part of the following courses:
* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularisation and Optimisation
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Sequence Models
